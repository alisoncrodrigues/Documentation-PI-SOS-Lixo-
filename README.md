# Documentation - PI: SOSLixo 

## Overview
One out of every six people in Pernambuco does not have access to household waste collection. As a result, they resort to alternative ways of disposing of their garbage, such as burning it or dumping it in vacant lots, hillsides, rivers, and other public areas. 

The **SOSLixo** app aims to solve this problem by sending reports and notifications to local governments about waste dumped in unauthorized locations.
